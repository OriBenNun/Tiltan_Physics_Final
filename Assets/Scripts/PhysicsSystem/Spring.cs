        // A spring obeys Hooke's Law, which states that the force exerted by a spring is directly
        // proportional to the displacement of the spring from its equilibrium position. Mathematically,
        // it can be represented as: F = -k * x
        // Where:
        // F is the force exerted by the spring.
        // k is the spring constant, representing the stiffness of the spring.
        // x is the displacement from the equilibrium position.
        // In the context of your cannon mechanic, you can simulate this behavior by gradually increasing
        // the force applied to the projectile as the spring (in this case, the charging mechanic) is
        // stretched. This can be achieved by adjusting the value of k or by directly modifying the
        // displacement x based on how long the player holds down the shoot button.
        
        // Here's how you can apply Hooke's Law to your cannon charging mechanic:
        // Initialize Spring Parameters: Set up parameters such as the spring constant (k),
        // the maximum displacement (x max), and the minimum and maximum shoot forces.
        // Calculate Displacement: Track how long the shoot button is held down and use this information
        // to calculate the displacement of the "spring" (charging mechanic).
        // You can use a formula like x=k⋅t, where t is the time the shoot button is held down.
        // Calculate Force: Apply Hooke's Law to calculate the force to be applied to the projectile using
        // the displacement calculated in the previous step. Shoot Projectile: Use the calculated force to shoot
        // the projectile.
